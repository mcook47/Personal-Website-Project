                        <p>Education: I am a Brigham Young Univeristy enrolled undergraduate student in the pre-business program and accomplishing a minor in Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Work Experience: During my freshman year at Brigham Young University, I took an internship class and worked for The Center for Teaching and Learning on Campus. We helped them organize and plan a large conference event. The next semester I was hired on by one of the consultants as his assistant and helped run the entire event. I then served a full-time, year and a half, mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Hokkaido, Japan. Following which, I worked for the same church's North Asia Office in Tokyo as the communication department's head assistant. During this time we organized many different aspects of the Tokyo Temple Open House. Now I work for the Missionary Training Center in Provo as an Online Trainer. I mainly work with missions all across Asia.</p>
                        <p>Skills: Throughout my work experience I have been able to learn quite a bit about marketing. I have run google, instagram, and facebook ad campaigns. I particularly know Meta Business Suite very well. I also have experience using and navigating Tableau. I first starting using Tableau in my job at the MTC. I also had the opportunity to learn how to create these analytical graphs and tools in an Information Systems class at Brigham Young Univeristy. I have experience using Japanese in the business world, specifically while I was working as an assitant in Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>Hobbies: I sing classical opera and took piano and flute for many years. I enjoy the great outdoors, consider myself a ski finatic and played tennis since my early childhood.</p>
